**PS**:
If you have trouble making a request to another domain (a different subdomain or port number also constitutes as another domain), please familiarize yourself with all the intricacies and limitations of [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) requests. Because CORS requires participation of the server by implementing specific HTTP response headers, it is often nontrivial to set up or debug. CORS is exclusively handled by the browser's internal mechanisms which this polyfill cannot influence.

Use **Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *** chrome extension to view images.
